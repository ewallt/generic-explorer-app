He saw divine foreknowledge as compatible with human agency, portraying God as a teacher who guides rather than dictates human choices. Clement's view of divine providence suggested that God engages dynamically with creation, allowing genuine human response to divine initiatives.

He believed in a non-coercive divine guidance that respects human freedom while still accomplishing God's purposes. Clement's integration of Greek philosophical concepts with Christian theology established an intellectual tradition that valued rational inquiry alongside faith. His emphasis on knowledge (gnosis) as essential to spiritual growth suggests that he viewed the divine-human relationship as cooperative rather than unilaterally determined. This perspective would later influence Eastern Orthodox theology's synergistic understanding of salvation."

He argued that God, as an infinitely wise and loving being, possesses foreknowledge of human choices but does not causally determine them. Origen's theological framework emphasized the soul's preexistence, spiritual progression, and the idea that God's knowledge operates in harmony with human freedom. While he did not articulate Open Theism as later theologians would, his rejection of strict determinism set a foundation for non-Augustinian views of divine providence.

He maintained that divine foreknowledge of future events doesn't causally determine those events, distinguishing between God knowing what will happen and God causing it to happen. This nuanced position allowed him to maintain both divine foreknowledge and human responsibility without sacrificing either. Origen's controversial doctrine of apokatastasis (universal restoration) further reflected his conviction that God's ultimate purposes would be accomplished through persuasion rather than coercion. Despite later theological rejections of aspects of his thought, Origen's emphasis on God's loving relationality with creation and his defense of meaningful human freedom established important theological categories that would resurface in later discussions about divine providence and creaturely agency."

Influenced by Platonic and Origenist thought, Gregory saw divine foreknowledge not as coercive but as a reflection of God's wisdom and relational engagement with creation. His theological emphasis on divine adaptability and the progressive sanctification of the soul aligns with later Open Theist perspectives.

He understood human freedom as essential to this process, viewing it not as an obstacle to divine purposes but as their fulfillment. Gregory's concept of epektasis—perpetual progress toward an infinite God—requires a genuine relationship rather than predetermined outcomes. This theological anthropology implies a God who responds to human decisions while guiding the overall trajectory of creation. His integration of philosophical concepts with biblical revelation created space for understanding divine knowledge as compatible with genuine contingency in human affairs. Gregory's theology thus provides historical precedent for contemporary discussions about the relational nature of divine providence."

He argued that God's knowledge of the future is absolute and unchangeable, which led him to develop a strong doctrine of predestination. According to Augustine, human free will is real but operates under divine grace, which ultimately determines salvation. His influence set the stage for later deterministic systems, including Calvinism. Open Theists critique Augustine's model, arguing that it makes human decisions irrelevant and portrays God as an all-controlling sovereign rather than a relational being.

His emphasis on divine sovereignty emerged partly as a response to the Pelagian controversy, where he defended the necessity of God's grace against what he saw as human presumption. While Augustine affirmed human free will, he placed it within strict boundaries of divine determination, creating a tension that theologians have wrestled with for centuries. His concept of predestination was developed further by medieval scholastics and later by Protestant Reformers like Luther and Calvin. Open Theists argue that Augustine's views were unduly influenced by Greek philosophical notions of divine impassibility and timelessness, which they believe compromise the biblical portrayal of God as responsive and emotionally engaged with humanity."

Rooted in Aristotelian philosophy, his theology asserted that God exists outside of time, seeing past, present, and future in an eternal 'now.' This view, known as divine timelessness, became a cornerstone of classical theism and the primary position that Open Theism would later challenge. Aquinas maintained that God's knowledge does not negate human free will, but struggled to reconcile divine omniscience with genuine contingency. His framework of divine simplicity and immutability—where God cannot change or be affected by creation—stands in direct contrast to Open Theism's relational divine model. Aquinas' influence remains dominant in Catholic theology, providing the philosophical foundation that Open Theists must engage with, even as they reject its conclusions."

He proposed that God knows future contingents not by causing them directly, but by knowing His own nature perfectly and how all possibilities flow from divine causality. This 'eternal now' perspective allowed Aquinas to maintain that God's foreknowledge is infallible while insisting that some events remain genuinely contingent from the human perspective. Open Theists critique this solution as merely linguistic, arguing that if future free choices are already known with certainty by God, they cannot be truly contingent regardless of how we frame the issue. They further contend that Aquinas's commitment to divine impassibility—the view that God cannot be affected by creation—renders authentic relationship with humanity problematic, as relationship implies mutual influence."

Unlike Luther, who largely confined predestination to soteriology, Calvin extended divine determinism to all events in creation. His insistence that God 'foresees future events only in consequence of his decree' effectively collapses divine foreknowledge into foreordination. While Calvin maintained human responsibility for sin, critics argue his system creates moral contradictions by making God the ultimate cause of evil while holding creatures culpable. Open Theists particularly object to Calvin's understanding of providence as micromanaging all events, suggesting it turns human history into a divine monologue rather than a genuine dialogue between Creator and creatures."

He argued that God possesses knowledge of all possible choices individuals might make in any given situation, allowing Him to shape the world accordingly while preserving free will. Molina's model attempted to uphold both divine sovereignty and genuine human agency, providing an alternative to both strict determinism and Open Theism. Some scholars see middle knowledge as a mediating position between classical theism and Open Theism, though Open Theists typically reject Molina's assumption that God meticulously arranges the world based on counterfactual knowledge."

By proposing a logical moment between God's knowledge of all possibilities and His decree of what will actually occur, Molina carved out space for libertarian freedom within a framework of exhaustive divine foreknowledge. His influence extends beyond Catholic theology into contemporary evangelical discussions, particularly through scholars like William Lane Craig and Alvin Plantinga. However, Open Theists identify significant problems with Molinism, questioning whether counterfactuals of freedom can have determinate truth values before the agent's decision and whether such a system truly preserves divine responsiveness. They argue that while Molina's system appears to grant creatures freedom, it ultimately reduces human history to the outworking of a script God selected from eternity past."

This nuanced position allowed him to affirm traditional views of divine omniscience while rejecting the deterministic implications of Reformed scholasticism. Arminius maintained that divine foreknowledge logically follows rather than precedes God's decree to create a world with genuinely free creatures. Despite being frequently mischaracterized by his opponents, Arminius sought to preserve both divine sovereignty and human responsibility within a coherent theological framework.
