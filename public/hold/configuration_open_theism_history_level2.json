He saw divine foreknowledge as compatible with human agency, portraying God as a teacher who guides rather than dictates human choices. Clement's view of divine providence suggested that God engages dynamically with creation, allowing genuine human response to divine initiatives. While not an Open Theist, his thought contributed to an early theological framework that resisted deterministic interpretations of divine omniscience."

He argued that God, as an infinitely wise and loving being, possesses foreknowledge of human choices but does not causally determine them. Origen's theological framework emphasized the soul's preexistence, spiritual progression, and the idea that God's knowledge operates in harmony with human freedom. While he did not articulate Open Theism as later theologians would, his rejection of strict determinism set a foundation for non-Augustinian views of divine providence. His ideas were later condemned as heretical, but they influenced future discussions on the nature of God's knowledge and relationality."

He rejected deterministic views, emphasizing that God's providence operates in a way that allows human beings to genuinely participate in their moral and spiritual development. Influenced by Platonic and Origenist thought, Gregory saw divine foreknowledge not as coercive but as a reflection of God's wisdom and relational engagement with creation. His theological emphasis on divine adaptability and the progressive sanctification of the soul aligns with later Open Theist perspectives. While his ideas did not directly challenge classical theism, his rejection of rigid determinism was an important precursor to later theological debates on divine omniscience and freedom."

            "description": "Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD) profoundly shaped Western Christianity's understanding of divine foreknowledge and predestination. He argued that God's knowledge of the future is absolute and unchangeable, which led him to develop a strong doctrine of predestination. According to Augustine, human free will is real but operates under divine grace, which ultimately determines salvation. His influence set the stage for later deterministic systems, including Calvinism. Open Theists critique Augustine's model, arguing that it makes human decisions irrelevant and portrays God as an all-controlling sovereign rather than a relational being. Despite this criticism, Augustine's theological legacy remains deeply embedded in much of Christian thought.\n\nAugustine's theological framework was heavily influenced by his personal journey from Manichaeism to Christianity and his Neo-Platonic philosophical background. His emphasis on divine sovereignty emerged partly as a response to the Pelagian controversy, where he defended the necessity of God's grace against what he saw as human presumption. While Augustine affirmed human free will, he placed it within strict boundaries of divine determination, creating a tension that theologians have wrestled with for centuries. His concept of predestination was developed further by medieval scholastics and later by Protestant Reformers like Luther and Calvin. Open Theists argue that Augustine's views were unduly influenced by Greek philosophical notions of divine impassibility and timelessness, which they believe compromise the biblical portrayal of God as responsive and emotionally engaged with humanity."

Rooted in Aristotelian philosophy, his theology asserted that God exists outside of time, seeing past, present, and future in an eternal 'now.' This view, known as divine timelessness, became a cornerstone of classical theism and the primary position that Open Theism would later challenge. Aquinas maintained that God's knowledge does not negate human free will, but struggled to reconcile divine omniscience with genuine contingency. His framework of divine simplicity and immutability—where God cannot change or be affected by creation—stands in direct contrast to Open Theism's relational divine model. Aquinas' influence remains dominant in Catholic theology, providing the philosophical foundation that Open Theists must engage with, even as they reject its conclusions."

Molina's model attempted to uphold both divine sovereignty and genuine human agency, providing an alternative to both strict determinism and Open Theism. Some scholars see middle knowledge as a mediating position between classical theism and Open Theism, though Open Theists typically reject Molina's assumption that God meticulously arranges the world based on counterfactual knowledge."

He argues that many biblical passages depict God as genuinely interacting with creation, changing plans, and responding to human decisions.
